        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Our project focuses on addressing the difficulties healthcare workers experience 
            using digital tools in their workplace. Specifically, we decided to interview Medical 
            Assistants and discuss any challenges they are currently facing. Medical Assistants 
            are the backbone for healthcare centers—they are the ones maintaining medical records, 
            interacting with patients, and handling medical equipment. Understanding their role's 
            significance drove us to talk with medical assistants at an urgent care in San Jose and 
            a health center in San Diego respectively. By addressing any challenges they face, we 
            aim to improve their interaction with healthcare technology, ultimately enhancing patient 
            care and operational efficiency.
        </p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>As a key contributor to this project, I was involved in multiple phases of the design and research process, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducting user research and gathering insights to inform design decisions</li>
                <li>Creating user personas and portfolios to understand target demographics</li>
                <li>Mapping out workflows and user interactions for seamless experiences</li>
                <li>Designing both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma</li>
                <li>Writing portions of the case study and documentation for clarity and presentation</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This was a collaborative project with a team of four, where I worked closely with other designers to ensure a cohesive user experience.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>How can we design a streamlined process that efficiently manages patient data and communicates 
            it to relevant medical staff with software, allowing them to focus on patient care instead of 
            technical difficulties?</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>For our user research, we conducted two interviews: one via Zoom and one in person, each lasting 
            approximately one hour. Our interviewees were both medical assistants, working for different clinics.
            After obtaining consent to record the interviews, we asked the participants to share an overview of 
            their position, their organization, and how long they've been working there. We then inquired about 
            their role, typical responsibilities, and what a typical week at work looks like for them. From 
            there, we transitioned to discussing their primary tasks and the apps or tools they currently use in 
            their work. They walked us through how they use these tools, the challenges they encounter, 
            and the specific aspects of the tools they would like to see improved.</p>
        <button class="accordion">User Research Findings</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3>Stakeholder #1</h3>
            <p><strong>Participant 1</strong>, a medical assistant at an urgent care in San Jose, manages both 
                front and back office responsibilities, including patient intake, triage, and assisting with procedures 
                like blood draws and rapid tests. Her role also involves extensive documentation using two primary 
                systems: <strong>Kyla</strong> for charting and AI-powered transcription, and <strong>DrChrono</strong> 
                for scheduling and insurance processing. While Kyla is the preferred tool for most tasks, Participant 1 
                must frequently switch between the two due to limited integration, creating inefficiencies and adding to 
                her workload.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Key pain points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>DrChrono is slow, outdated, and lacks auto-save.</li>
                <li>Kyla has rigid templates and lacks scheduling/insurance features.</li>
                <li>Both systems require manual re-entry due to incomplete data synchronization.</li>
                <li>Desires an integrated system with auto-save, customizable charting, and better synchronization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stakeholder #2</h3>
            <p><strong>Participant 2</strong> from a health center in San Diego has been a Discharge Medical 
                Assistant for 1 year and 5 months. His primary responsibilities include scheduling patient appointments, 
                managing imaging and lab orders, and troubleshooting operational issues. He uses <strong>ECW, Google Suite, 
                and 3CX</strong> in his workflow.</p>

            <p><strong>Key pain points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>ECW has inefficient UI with cluttered navigation and redundant text.</li>
                <li>Lack of integrated messaging, leading to the use of third-party apps.</li>
                <li>Google Suite is used for unofficial notes that can't be stored in ECW.</li>
                <li>3CX Phone App lacks search functionality, requiring manual scrolling.</li>
                <li>Wants a unified system that integrates all tools to reduce inefficiencies.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Personas & User Journeys</h2>
        <p>We developed fictional personas to better understand the needs of our target audience.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <h3>User Flow 1</h3>
        <img src="media/images/case-study/ux-flow-1.png" alt="UX Flow 1" style="width: 80%; max-width: 500px;">
        <p>This UX flow addresses the problem of not having integrated features on the same software. Although 
            Kyla had a simpler and more user friendly interface, it was missing the scheduling features of DrChrono 
            that allowed the medical staff to see the status of patients during their appointment process. Our extension 
            of Kyla would add this calendar page as its own section from the sidebar menu. We chose the entry point to be 
            from this button on the home page, as it is a page the medical assistants view often and find helpful, based on 
            our interviews. The simplicity in the tool and integration would allow Susan White to not have to adapt to multiple 
            technologies. While this extension pulls from DrChrono and ECW's scheduling pages, our flow extends the options of 
            what details can be shown and statuses to update, such as tasks, tests to run, and prescriptions that can be assigned 
            to different medical staff. This might help to address Daniel George's lack of messaging to communicate with other 
            physicians because it would allow all medical staff to see updates on what stages patients and tasks are in.</p>
        <h3>User Flow 2</h3>
        <img src="media/images/case-study/ux-flow-2.png" alt="UX Flow 2" style="width: 80%; max-width: 500px;">
        <p>This second UX flow begins with the user opening up Kyla, an existing healthcare app. We determined that a calendar 
            extension would be a critical addition, providing a visual representation of the clinic's appointments/agenda. To 
            ensure seamless access without unnecessary navigational steps, we placed the calendar entry point on the landing page. 
            The patient data is organized in a clear, user-friendly format, making it easy to locate specific information instead 
            of having to search through multiple sections of the software. Similar to services like Google Calendar, the user has 
            the option to view the calendar in various modes for flexible scheduling. Additionally, inspired by other medical scheduling 
            services (e.g. ECW, referenced in one of our interviews), the user has preset patient status fields to streamline clinic 
            workflow.</p>

            <p>These sketches were based off of flow 1, showing the main pages that users would interact with 
                in this flow. The first 3 sketches are of users who want to see and edit an existing event and 
                the second 3 sketches are of users who go through the process of making a new event. The main 
                calendar page layout is based on DrChrono's scheduling page and the detail pages incorporate some 
                elements from Google Calendar. </p>

            <p>These sketches are based on the existing Kyla interface. The first two implements a full screen 
                calendar and half screen calendar, with the next two sketches implement the event detail view, and 
                the last one shows the task page.

            <p>These sketches are based on Flow 2. The first sketch provides an overview of the calendar page, 
                assuming the user has already selected the calendar icon from the homepage. It also includes features 
                like events, schedule, home, and more. The following four sketches represent different calendar views: 
                day, week, month, and agenda. Certain elements were inspired by Google Calendar.

                One screen shows a close up of an event if the user clicks on a specific one. This screen includes more 
                details about the event and the patient, as well as gives an option to edit. These sketches incorporate 
                elements from Google Calendar, Kyla, and other medical scheduling softwares.

        <h2>Hi-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
        <button class="accordion">Wireframes</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3>Prototype A</h3>
            <img src="media/images/case-study/hi-fi-1.png" alt="Wireframe 1" style="width: 80%; max-width: 500px;">
            <h3>Prototype B</h3>
            <img src="media/images/case-study/hi-fi-2.png" alt="Wireframe 2" style="width: 80%; max-width: 500px;">
            <p>For our 2 calendar prototypes, we chose to focus on a room-based approach (Prototype A) and an 
                agenda-based approach (Prototype B). For both prototypes, we wanted the default view to be a 
                “Week View”, which was something we drew from various UI sketches in Milestone 3. 
                Prototype A's daily view shows the calendar events grouped by room (screen 2), with each column 
                representing a different exam or surgery room. The rows still show the hourly time. This view was 
                inspired by the option given in DrChrono's schedule feature, allowing physicians to visualize where 
                patients are and what rooms are available over time. When creating a new event (screens 3 and 4), a 
                split view side drawer appears for maximum space to input more detail. There are 2 pages, with the 
                first focusing on patient and appointment details, and the second optional one giving the ability to 
                add tasks. Viewing an already created appointment also opens that side drawer with the option to update 
                statuses directly from the dropdowns without needing to use the edit button. This prototype was heavily 
                inspired by the Flow 1 Version 1 UI sketches with the condensing of some sections of creating a new event.
                
                For Prototype B, clicking the Agenda button leads to a side screen that displays the tasks for the office. 
                This was slightly different from our UI sketches from Milestone 3, in which we had the Agenda view take up 
                the full screen. We concluded that having a split screen would allow the user to still interact with the 
                calendar on the side, which would be visually helpful. Additionally, we added a filtering feature that allows 
                the user to see their specific tasks rather than everyone's. By narrowing down the information to the individual, 
                the filtering option provides a personal, efficient user experience.

        <div class="panel">
            <h3>Stakeholder #1</h3>
            <p>Stakeholder #1 was the same as our previous participant #1, a medical assistant at an urgent 
                care in San Diego. One of her main confusions was what the tasks section on the left side bar 
                was for. She wouldn't normally consider appointments under the category of tasks and found it 
                redundant to mark tasks as complete if the status is already being changed. She preferred having 
                the side bar always visible with the month calendar. She found the creating event popup intuitive 
                and contained all the information she would need to input. She preferred for tasks to be organized 
                under what patient they're attached to and to show urgency with colors instead of a due date. She 
                would primarily use the shared tasks out of all of the pages so that other medical staff could be 
                on the same page on what is being done. 
            </p>
            <h3>Stakeholder #2</h3>
            <p>Stakeholder #2 was the same as our previous participant #2,  a medical assistant at a health center in 
                San Diego. His suggestions included minor fixes such as alignment adjustments, adding appropriate titles, 
                and improving the organization of status appointments on the homepage's week view. For the day view, he 
                recommended including a profile picture, similar to the week view. He also suggested displaying additional 
                event details, such as the patient's date of birth (DOB), reason for visit, and the assigned doctor. In 
                the event details popup, he preferred using "OK" instead of "Save" to confirm changes, as "Save" could 
                create confusion by implying that a file is being saved. Additionally, he proposed changing “Add Title” to 
                “Reason for Visit” for better clarity. Regarding patient search functionality, he recommended offering 
                multiple search options, such as DOB, patient record number, and name. He also preferred a movable popup 
                instead of a split-screen layout. For the event details popup, he found some symbols unclear and suggested 
                adding more clarity about the patient's visit purpose. For individual tasks, he advised displaying tasks in 
                separate boxes rather than as a checklist and recommended adding a toggle to minimize or expand the task bar.</p>

                Overall, we made several changes to our high fidelity prototypes in response to the feedback we got. 
                While the layout of each page remained the same, we were able to receive feedback to improve the smaller 
                details of our final prototype. Here are some improvements relating to the two screens above: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>In our main calendar (week view and day view), we updated the colors which were meant to indicate status 
                    to be more vibrant, as well as accessible to colorblind individuals. We also updated the statuses to reflect 
                    the actual stages of an appointment, rather than our assumptions of the process.</li>
                <li>As for the event details popup, we added more distinct separations to the types of information relevant to the 
                    appointment, since our initial organization and hierarchy of information was confusing for stakeholders view quickly.</li>
                <li>We also changed our side bar from “tasks” to “upcoming appointments” - which provides more important and relevant 
                    information to medical assistants.</li>
                <li>Regarding visual changes, we made our screens more consistent (corner radiuses, font sizes, button and pop-up components, etc).</li>
                <li>We also updated our calendar appearance to be more resembling of a calendar app, as opposed to a standard spreadsheet table.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This project was an eye-opening experience that deepened my understanding of UI/UX design and user research. 
           Working closely with medical assistants gave me valuable insights into how healthcare workers interact with 
           digital tools, highlighting the importance of usability and efficiency in software design.</p>
    
        <p>One of the biggest challenges was balancing user needs with system constraints. While designing the calendar 
           interface, we had to ensure it was both intuitive and functional, addressing user pain points such as 
           scheduling inefficiencies and task management confusion. Through multiple iterations, usability testing, and 
           stakeholder feedback, we refined our design to enhance workflow efficiency.</p>
    
        <p>This project reinforced the importance of collaborative design, as working in a team of four required 
           constant communication and iteration. Additionally, prototyping in Figma helped me sharpen my wireframing 
           and high-fidelity design skills. If given more time, I would further refine the task management integration
           and explore alternative visual representations for patient status tracking.</p>
    
        <p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this experience! It solidified my passion for human-centered design, and I look 
           forward to applying these learnings to future projects.</p>
